# MesonetViewer
<b>To Use:</b> Download, extract, rezip everything in the master folder and then import that zip file into eclipse as an existing project. The actual code can be found in the src folder.

<b>The Project:</b> After importing the weather data from a single day, the MesonetViewer can go through it and find the maximum and minimum of the solar radiation, air temperature at 1.5m, air temperature at 9m, and windspeed of that day. See "Viewer.png." for an example.
